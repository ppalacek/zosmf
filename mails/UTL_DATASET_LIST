You can do this directly from the catalog – basically:
*look in the column catalog for those 3 column names, group by table, and keep only tables that have all 3.*

### Db2 for z/OS

```sql
SELECT
    c.tbcreator,
    c.tbname
FROM
    sysibm.syscolumns c
WHERE
    UPPER(c.name) IN ('DBNAME','OBJNAME','PARTITION')
GROUP BY
    c.tbcreator,
    c.tbname
HAVING
    COUNT(DISTINCT UPPER(c.name)) = 3      -- all three columns exist
ORDER BY
    c.tbcreator,
    c.tbname;
```

If you only want “normal” tables (not views etc.), you can join SYSTABLES:

```sql
SELECT
    t.creator,
    t.name
FROM
    sysibm.systables t
JOIN
    sysibm.syscolumns c
      ON t.name     = c.tbname
     AND t.creator  = c.tbcreator
WHERE
    UPPER(c.name) IN ('DBNAME','OBJNAME','PARTITION')
    AND t.type = 'T'                      -- base table
GROUP BY
    t.creator,
    t.name
HAVING
    COUNT(DISTINCT UPPER(c.name)) = 3
ORDER BY
    t.creator,
    t.name;
```

### Db2 LUW equivalent (if you ever need it)

```sql
SELECT
    col.tabschema,
    col.tabname
FROM
    syscat.columns col
WHERE
    UPPER(col.colname) IN ('DBNAME','OBJNAME','PARTITION')
GROUP BY
    col.tabschema,
    col.tabname
HAVING
    COUNT(DISTINCT UPPER(col.colname)) = 3
ORDER BY
    col.tabschema,
    col.tabname;
```

Run this on the “other system” and it’ll tell you which table(s) have those three columns, if any.
